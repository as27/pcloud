# pCloud

A wrapper for the pcloud API

## API-Server

Before you start using the pCloud-API you need to find out where your servers are. Europe and US are having different Subdomains (https://docs.pcloud.com).

As Go supports HTTPS just the SSL-Protocol is used. The base of the API-calls are:

* Europe: https://eapi.pcloud.com
* US: https://api.pcloud.com
